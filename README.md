# TinDog 🐶

TinDog is a fun, imaginary dating website for dogs, inspired by the idea of combining pet enthusiasm with modern web development. This project was created to practice and demonstrate full-stack skills including frontend design, backend development, and RESTful API integration using **FastAPI**.

It’s a playful concept meant to sharpen my technical skills while building something entertaining and interactive.
